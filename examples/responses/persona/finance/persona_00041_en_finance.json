However, I am also aware that extreme inequality can lead to systemic risks. Therefore, I would have to consider the larger context to make a truly informed decision. In this isolated scenario, since my own outcome is the same in both scenarios, I lean towards the choice that gives more to A, with the caveat that this is a highly simplified situation.",
