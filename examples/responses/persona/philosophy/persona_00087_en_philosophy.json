Philosophically, Hegel's emphasis on the importance of synthesis and overcoming opposing viewpoints suggests that a more just distribution of resources may be the more rational choice. Although I get less, the fair distribution aligns better with these ethical considerations. It promotes a sense of equality and shared benefit, which contributes to a more harmonious outcome overall.

However, considering the principles of fairness and equity, Option Right offers a more balanced distribution where both individuals receive the same amount.
