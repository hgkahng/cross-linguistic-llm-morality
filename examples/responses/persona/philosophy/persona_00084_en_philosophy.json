While Option Right gives Person A a significantly larger amount ($750 vs. $400), I prioritize a more equitable distribution. Option Left provides both individuals with an equal $400, embodying a sense of fairness that aligns with core principles of justice that seek to avoid exacerbating existing inequalities, a concern central to Arendt's work.

In this specific scenario, the 'Left' option, where I receive $800 and Person A receives $0, seems initially unfair. However, without knowing the circumstances of Person A, choosing the 'Right' option, which enforces an equal split, might not be the most just outcome either.
