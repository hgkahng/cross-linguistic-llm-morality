In the 'Right' option, I still receive $400, but Person A receives $750. Since my own payout is the same in both scenarios, but the 'Right' option gives more money to Person A, the most rational choice would be 'Right'. Although the allocation is unequal, it doesn't negatively impact my payout and allows for a greater overall distribution of funds. However, considering the overall fairness and a potentially better outcome for both, I'll choose the option where the distribution is equal. Therefore, I will choose 'Left'.",
