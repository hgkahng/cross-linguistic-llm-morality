In this scenario, I must decide how to allocate money between myself and another person. While a perfectly 'invisible hand' outcome might suggest maximizing the total benefit, I should also consider fairness and my own well-being. Choosing 'Right' leads to an equal distribution of $400 each, which aligns with a sense of fairness. Choosing 'Left' gives me $800 and the other person $0. Although choosing 'Left' would give me more money, the equal distribution of 'Right' seems more justifiable in terms of fairness, given the context of distributive justice. However, since the prompt only asks for my choice as Person B and does not explicitly require me to maximize social welfare or act altruistically, I will choose the option that maximizes my own monetary gain. Therefore, I choose 'Left'.",
